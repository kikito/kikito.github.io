<p>This is not the first time I hear about the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like using
libraries&rdquo; thing, and I have been thinking about it for a while. I guess
this is a good place to expose my views on the matter.</p>

<p>You see, for me there are two kinds of tasks in programming: there is
<strong>Cool Stuff</strong> and there is <strong>Yak Shaving</strong>.</p>

<p>In a game, <strong>Cool Stuff</strong> is what your game is about - it could be a
great gameplay. It could be a really neat set of graphics. It could be a
really good story. Or very likable characters. Hell, it could be the
sound, if you are doing a musical game.</p>

<p>But there is usually lots of extra stuff that you also need for your
game to be considered &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. You need to handle the menu. The
animations. You need to store and retrieve information from files, etc.</p>

<p>All that stuff that &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t really make your game any cooler, but it&rsquo;s
still needed&rdquo;, is <strong>Yak Shaving</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem is that lots of people (me included) end up not doing the
Cool Stuff because they spend all their energy Yak Shaving. That is just
sad.</p>

<p>In my opinion, anything that saves you from Shaving a Yak so you can
spend time doing <strong>Cool Stuff</strong>, is good.</p>

<p>An example: you are using LÖVE instead of C++ and OpenGL, or direct
machine code. And yet it doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel like cheating&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s because
all LÖVE does is Yak Shaving. But you still need to do your part - you
need to do the Cool Stuff!</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;cross the country metaphor&rdquo;, using tween should not feel like
friend giving you a lift. It should feel like a friend giving you a pair
of good walking boots. You put them on and then, off you go! You are
still doing the important stuff - which is walking that long, long path.
It&rsquo;s only that now you don&rsquo;t have to worry about all the little pointy
pebbles in the way.</p>

<p>I also want to address the <em>&ldquo;but if I use libraries, I will not
learn!&rdquo;</em> concern.</p>

<p>First of all, I think learning is great. I&rsquo;m all for learning. And I think that it is a proven fact that learning from others is more effective than having to learn it by yourself. A good teacher will explain the Theory of relativity in one hour. A class full of students, however bright they are, will forcefully take much longer than that to come up with the theory all by themselves.</p>

<p>If you want to learn, that is great) Just don&rsquo;t try to go &ldquo;macho&rdquo; and do
it on your own. Open up an existing lib, and see how other people have
already done it! Don&rsquo;t try to invent relativity, read a book about it!
Be efficient!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learnt so much by reading other people&rsquo;s source code. I make a o
point to make my libs as understandable as possible, just because of
this.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Sorry for the long rant. I will shut up now.</p>
