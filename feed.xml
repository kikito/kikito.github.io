    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I &lt;a href="/https://kikito.github.io/blog/2012/03/06/starting-the-blog-with-octopress/"&gt;created this space&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://octopress.org/"&gt;octopress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience was not pleasant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Octopress has a very &amp;ldquo;kitchen-sink&amp;rdquo; mindset. In a way, it provides too many tools by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The work folder is too cluttered with auxiliary files and folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing a new post was an ordeal - partly because octopress&amp;#39; layout was so alien.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much of the pain points I got from using Octopress could actually be attributed to &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish much on this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Jekyll quite often in the past - I used it almost for any static site that I needed to do. I&amp;rsquo;ve answered a significant amount of Jekyll-related questions in &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com"&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past this made sense: Jekyll was the best static site generator that I knew. But that is not the case any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middleman is a modern static site generator that solves much of the pain points that came with Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not use &lt;a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/"&gt;liquid markup&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very limited and clunky templating language. Instead, templates can be created using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERuby"&gt;Eruby&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="http://haml.info/"&gt;HAML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It supports &lt;a href="http://sass-lang.com/"&gt;SASS and SCSS&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the-box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not limited to blogs; it can be used to generate any kind of static website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has lots of plugins available; middleman plugins are regular ruby gems, which simplifies things enormously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration stays in a single place, &lt;code&gt;config.rb&lt;/code&gt; (you could have a &lt;code&gt;Rakefile&lt;/code&gt; too, but it&amp;rsquo;s optional) instead of the 4 required by Octopress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the folder layout of &lt;a href="https://github.com/kikito/kikito.github.io/tree/source"&gt;my middleman-based repo&lt;/a&gt; is much cleaner than &lt;a href="https://github.com/kikito/old-blog/tree/source"&gt;the old octopress-based one&lt;/a&gt;.
Creating posts is easier (they have less metadata). Publishing is easier too (very simple commands)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I know myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up adding a &lt;code&gt;Rakefile&lt;/code&gt; to automate things a bit more, so that instead of using 2 commands to publish stuff I can do it with just one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me, Jekyll is dead. Long life middleman.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently acquired a new development machine - A Mac Book Air. I had
been resisting it for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a very fine machine, but I’m not familiar with its operative
system (I used to use Ubuntu on a custom-made PC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a couple days installing and configuring it for development
usage (mostly Ruby on Rails). Here’s what I’ve done so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="locate-the-terminal"&gt;Locate the terminal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to find the terminal using the &amp;ldquo;find tool&amp;rdquo; (a little
magnifier glass near the top right of the screen) and typing &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo;.
Once I clicked on it, it appeared on the Dock. I &amp;ldquo;left-clicked&amp;rdquo; (clicked
with two fingers) on it to display a contextual menu. I choose
&lt;code&gt;Options &amp;gt; Keep in Dock&lt;/code&gt; so I didn’t have to look for it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="upgrade-the-operative-system"&gt;Upgrade the Operative System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new version of OSX (codename &amp;ldquo;Mountain Lion&amp;rdquo;) had been released the
day before my laptop arrived. Knowing that updates do sometimes provoke
conflict with installed software, the first thing I did after booting up
the machine was upgrading its operative system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSX comes with a software called &amp;ldquo;App Store&amp;rdquo;. The upgrade was sold
there, and was prominently advertised as well. If you have ever
installed one application in a smartphone, the procedure was very
similar - downloading the operative system took some time, since it
weighted 4GB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the download finished, the computer requested a reboot. I noticed
a couple issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Mountain Lion comes with a new security &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; that blocks
installing software that doesn’t come from the App Store - If OSX
complains that &amp;ldquo;the developer is using an unkonwn signature&amp;rdquo; or
something similar, activate the corresponding option in
&lt;code&gt;Apple Menu &amp;gt; System Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;amp; Privacy &amp;gt; Allow Applications downloaded from: Anywhere&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I also noticed later on that the encoding is not set by default.
This gave me issues later on when I started using ruby and Unicode
stuff. In order to fix this, you must remember to add the following
to your .profile/.bashrc/.zshrc:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;LANG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;en_US.UTF-8
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;LC_ALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;en_US.UTF-8
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="install-gcc-for-osx"&gt;Install gcc for OSX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macs come with no compiler installed by default. From what I could
understand, the development environment is called &amp;ldquo;XCode&amp;rdquo;. It’s a big
download, another 4GB (later on I found some claims that you don’t need
to download the whole XCode; the compiler can apparently be downloaded
separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I opted for an alternative approach: I used
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/"&gt;gcc-for-osx&lt;/a&gt; .
Installing it is very straightforward; download, double-click business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="install-ruby"&gt;Install ruby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the compiler is in place, you can install ruby. The recommended way
to do that is via a ruby version manager. There are two main ones: &lt;code&gt;rvm&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;rbenv&lt;/code&gt;. My personal preference is the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process finishes downloading and compiling, it is usually a
good idea to set the default ruby version. At the time of this writing,
it is ruby 1.9.3. So I did this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.bashrc
rvm use 1.9.3 —default
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, you should be able to execute &lt;code&gt;ruby --version&lt;/code&gt; and
obtain ‘1.9.3’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I later on installed ruby 1.9.2 since I need it for this blog (which is
done in &lt;a href="http://octopress.org"&gt;octopress&lt;/a&gt; , and it does not work in ruby
1.9.3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;rvm install 1.9.2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="install-homebrew"&gt;Install homebrew&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebrew is a tool for installing packages from the command line. I
think of it as an &amp;ldquo;very limited apt-tools package&amp;rdquo;. But it’s the best
there is on OSX, so you might as well install it. Here’s how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;ruby -e &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once homebrew is installed, you can use it to install other useful
packages. For example, git and wget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;brew install git
brew install wget
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vim"&gt;Vim&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I needed was a better console, and a decent source code
editor. I am used to Vim in Ubuntu, so the natural choice in OSX is
using &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/"&gt;macvim&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebrew has a recipe for installing vim, but it doesn’t work if you
have installed gcc instead of XCode, as I’ve done. So I had to download
it from the website, and manually create a couple aliases .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very happy to report that
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kikito/adegan"&gt;Adegan&lt;/a&gt;, my custom Vim configuration,
seems to have work very well in macvim. To install it I had to use the
same command I use in Ubuntu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;curl -Lo- https://raw.github.com/kikito/adegan/master/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iterm2-and-zsh"&gt;iterm2 and zsh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default terminal emulator is quite alright, but since I was
experimenting, I decided to install it’s &amp;ldquo;cool replacement&amp;rdquo;,
called &lt;a href="http://www.iterm2.com"&gt;iterm2&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this was a matter of
downloading and double clicking, and then dragging to the Applications
folder. Oh, and sticking it into the Dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I installed zsh, a replacement for bash. I did so from brew:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;brew install zsh
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I had to tell iterm2 to use zsh by default. That is done via this
command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;chsh --s /bin/zsh
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time a console is opened, it will use zsh instead of bash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then installed ohmyzsh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the version I installed by default sets the theme
to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;random&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. I edited the &lt;code&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file and set it to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;robbyrussell&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;,
which I’m used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="overall-experience"&gt;Overall experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that, in terms of installation and configuration, OSX is
intermediate. It is not as bad as Windows, where each piece of software
is installed and updated independently, but it is also not as pleasant
as Ubuntu, where almost everything is centralized via apt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that some applications required &amp;ldquo;double clicking&amp;rdquo; to be
installed, others had to be &amp;ldquo;extracted and copied to the Applications
folder&amp;rdquo;, while others had an &amp;ldquo;special window&amp;rdquo; where you could drag the
application icon to applications. And then there is the App Store, and
Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also adapting to the US keyboard layout, and doing some
experiments. I might post about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is one little tip you might not know: programming languages, like
spoken languages, have accents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe I’m stretching the metaphor a bit. But only a bit. So bear
with me while I dissert a bit about spoken languages. I promise it won’t
take too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-brief-detour-on-spoken-languages"&gt;A brief detour on Spoken Languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in the southern part of Spain. That region, known as
Andalusia, has it’s own accent. It has a distinct intonation has certain
slang, but its most prominent characteristic is the omission of
phonemes. I guess, to other Spanish speakers, Andalusian Spanish sounds
like a mixture of Scottish and Texas English. It is also kindof
considered “funny by default”. Some comediants use that accent to tell
jokes, even if they don’t usually speak like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Andalusian, after spending 9 years in Madrid, I have a
separate “compartment” in my head for Madrid’s accent, which we could
call “neutral Spanish”. I change between Andalusian and neutral
depending on who I am speaking to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also speak English and French. I only have one accent for each of
those, but I know them well enough to notice how different accents
sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This linguistic background has allowed me to notice certain …
differences here and there. Besides the obvious ones, like phonetical or
grammatical rules, I mean; more of the semantic kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, French people (at least people from Paris, which are the
ones I’m more familiar with) don’t even say “we”. I mean, they have a
word for it - “nous”. But they never use it when colloquially speaking.
Instead, they use the impersonal “on”, which roughtly translates to “it”
(as in “It is said that…”). So, when they mean “let’s go shopping” they
say something like “it should go shopping”. Crazy, right? Well, they do
it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say about English? It is so widely used that there are so
many things one can say. By hearing how they pronnouce the letter “r”,
one can say whether someone is from one side or the other of the
Atlantic. I wonder if some day “I wanna go” will be considered valid
English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Spain, no one says good-bye any more. There is a word for it, of
course - “Adiós”. But no one says it. Everyone says “see you soon”
instead. Even if it’s longer. Society has decided that “Adiós” is too …
hard, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say eskimos have 7 different words for “snow”. I don’t know if it’s
true. I know that my girlfriend, who grew in the northern part of Spain,
has 1 more word than me for saying “it rains”, in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-engineer-view"&gt;The Engineer View&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think that all men of science share a special sense of beauty.
Instead of (or in addition to) being able to find beauty in a work of
art, we find it in efficient, neatly organized systems and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at spoken languages from the point of view of an engineer, I
find them a bit … lacking. Spoken languages are not a very efficient
tool for communicating concepts. They require more effort than it’s
really necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanish verbs are crazily ornated. English does it better, but still
requires too much memory - why say “I am, you are, he is”, when you
could say “I be, you be, he be”?. Speaking of English, its
pronnounciation rules have too many exceptions and things that one has
to remember - tomato vs potato. That one is much simpler in Spanish. My
biggest grip with French is that even if lots of words are pronnounced
the same way, they are written differently. The fact that the word
“bureaucracy” has its roots on that particular language makes a lot of
sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="programming-languages-as-tools"&gt;Programming languages as tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at programming languages, I conserve that sense of beauty.
That is why I consider myself very fortunate to be able to work with a
programming language that I find aesthetically pleasant as an engineer.
I enjoy using the language, and seeing where it takes me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lua is another language that I enjoy. It is smaller than ruby, and
certainly less powerful, but the compromises it makes reflect what I
think an embedded language should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript is so ubiquous it hurts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course there are plenty of others. Lisp. Haskell. Erlang. Html.
Even CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, my sense of beauty is never satisfied. Ruby, which is my
favourite, is slow in some cases. The way it handles blocks troubles me.
Lua has implicit global variables, and its string manipulation library
is too barebones. Javascript … well, I used to enjoy it. After reading
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742"&gt;Javascript: the good
parts&lt;/a&gt;
, however, I can’t help but keep noticing the bad parts. Lisp doesn’t
feel like a language, it feels like raw
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"&gt;AST&lt;/a&gt; manipulation.
PHP… don’t get me started on PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, I have grudges with all of them. It would seem that I am
doomed to never be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-accent-in-programming-languages"&gt;The accent in programming languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to talk about the accent in programming languages. As I was
saying before, I think that there are “semantic differences” between
spoken languages. And I think those differences are even more
pronnounced in programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first programming language I ever learnt was BASIC, in the mighty
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum.2B"&gt;Spectrum 48k+&lt;/a&gt;
. Much later, in the University, I learnt C. And I programmed C exactly
like I programmed BASIC before. Then I learnt Java … and yet, I managed
to program it as if it was BASIC. Only though time, and gradual effort,
I managed to “get” this new “way of thinking” called “Object
orientation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and then I started to do Object Orientation in plain C. Which was a
mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve needed a lot of time to realize that every programming language has
its strenghts; and they are often not easily “exportable”. This is what
I call the “nature” of a language. This “nature” is not necessarily
related with the language’s grammar rules. For example, Javascript has
acquired an “asyncronous nature” recently, thanks to
&lt;a href="http://nodejs.org"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the nature of a programming language, you probably should not use
a grammar book. You will need a book which concentrates on “idiomatic
rules” instead. Or, you could spend an inordinate amount of time reading
other people’s code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when you learn your next programming language, don’t stop after you
learn the basic grammar rules. Try to concentrate on whether people say
“Adiós” with it. Or how many ways it has for saying “snow”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <name>Enrique García Cota</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started getting interested in &lt;a href="http://golang.org"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; (also known as &lt;em&gt;golang&lt;/em&gt;), one of the new programming languages being developed by Google (another one is &lt;a href="http://www.dartlang.org/"&gt;DART&lt;/a&gt; , but I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in that one. Yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first hurdles I have encontered is that the &lt;a href="http://golang.org/doc/install#freebsd_linux"&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; seem incomplete, at least for Ubuntu.
They tell you to go and download the source code and compile it on your machine. While I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid of compiling stuff myself, I&amp;rsquo;m not so fond of maintaining the compiled programs up-to-date manually. It reminds me of windows, brr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m trying new software I always try to find:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) The official apt-package with &lt;code&gt;apt-cache search&lt;/code&gt;, which will manage the updates for me, or
b) A &lt;a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ubuntu-ppa-technology-explained/"&gt;ppa&lt;/a&gt; , which is basically the same thing, except that
   instead of an &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; unkown Ubuntu guy these updates are managed by an unkown guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to find a ppa for golang and, lo and behold! &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/~gophers/+archive/go"&gt;There is one&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems reasonably official!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the official instructions don&amp;rsquo;t mention how to use this wonderful resource, allow me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash Install golang-stagle from the gophers/go ppa
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/go
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-stable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy! No compilations or anything needed. And when Go gets a new version, you will receive it as a software update. Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One minor thing though - Go expects you to have defined a &lt;code&gt;GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable. This variable should point to a place where the Go libraries (&amp;ldquo;packages&amp;rdquo;, in
Go lingo) are installed. For newbies (like me) it&amp;rsquo;s better if it&amp;rsquo;s a folder inside your home directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of creating it! (I name it &lt;code&gt;.go&lt;/code&gt; so it is invisible by default, but you may want to make it more public). Notice that there is no &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; on this line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;mkdir &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/.go
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, create the environment variable. Add this to your .bashrc, .zshrc or equivalent file, depending on whether you use bash, zsh or other shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;GOPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/.go
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next console you open will be prepared to execute go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for now. Go get some go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a copy of &lt;a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;amp;t=8608&amp;amp;amp;p=53181#p53181"&gt;a
post&lt;/a&gt;
I did recently in the LÖVE forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time I hear about the &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t like using
libraries&amp;rdquo; thing, and I have been thinking about it for a while. I guess
this is a good place to expose my views on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, for me there are two kinds of tasks in programming: there is
&lt;strong&gt;Cool Stuff&lt;/strong&gt; and there is &lt;strong&gt;Yak Shaving&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a game, &lt;strong&gt;Cool Stuff&lt;/strong&gt; is what your game is about - it could be a
great gameplay. It could be a really neat set of graphics. It could be a
really good story. Or very likable characters. Hell, it could be the
sound, if you are doing a musical game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is usually lots of extra stuff that you also need for your
game to be considered &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo;. You need to handle the menu. The
animations. You need to store and retrieve information from files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that stuff that &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make your game any cooler, but it&amp;rsquo;s
still needed&amp;rdquo;, is &lt;strong&gt;Yak Shaving&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that lots of people (me included) end up not doing the
Cool Stuff because they spend all their energy Yak Shaving. That is just
sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, anything that saves you from Shaving a Yak so you can
spend time doing &lt;strong&gt;Cool Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;, is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example: you are using LÖVE instead of C++ and OpenGL, or direct
machine code. And yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;feel like cheating&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s because
all LÖVE does is Yak Shaving. But you still need to do your part - you
need to do the Cool Stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;cross the country metaphor&amp;rdquo;, using tween should not feel like
friend giving you a lift. It should feel like a friend giving you a pair
of good walking boots. You put them on and then, off you go! You are
still doing the important stuff - which is walking that long, long path.
It&amp;rsquo;s only that now you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about all the little pointy
pebbles in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to address the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;but if I use libraries, I will not
learn!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I think learning is great. I&amp;rsquo;m all for learning. And I think that it is a proven fact that learning from others is more effective than having to learn it by yourself. A good teacher will explain the Theory of relativity in one hour. A class full of students, however bright they are, will forcefully take much longer than that to come up with the theory all by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn, that is great) Just don&amp;rsquo;t try to go &amp;ldquo;macho&amp;rdquo; and do
it on your own. Open up an existing lib, and see how other people have
already done it! Don&amp;rsquo;t try to invent relativity, read a book about it!
Be efficient!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt so much by reading other people&amp;rsquo;s source code. I make a o
point to make my libs as understandable as possible, just because of
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it. Sorry for the long rant. I will shut up now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Small Functions are Good for the Universe</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a copy of &lt;a href="https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2826&amp;amp;amp;p=33948#p33950"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; I
did some time ago in the LÖVE, which someone kindly reminded me of
today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-forbidden-for-a-function-to-do-two-different-things?"&gt;Why is it forbidden for a function to do two different things?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons. The first one is that functions are supposed to
be reusable. If you divide a big function into smaller functions, you
can reuse those smaller functions in other places. The other reason is
that by giving proper names to those functions, your code looks more
like English and less than machine code. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to understand for
humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big function is like a landscape that one has to explore in order to
&amp;ldquo;understand&amp;rdquo;. When you have smaller functions with significant names,
those names act as &amp;ldquo;signposts&amp;rdquo; indicating where the code &amp;ldquo;goes&amp;rdquo; to
humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-would-you-use-instead?"&gt;What would you use instead?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a function does two things, you divide it in two functions, give
those functions proper, significant, pronounceable names, and call those
functions from the original one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have a big function like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: I&amp;rsquo;ll be using my class library, middleclass, tangentially, just
to show how a good design and object orientation facilitate making
stuff)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight lua"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;math.huge&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ipairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;players&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Bullet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;math.atan2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lots of functions like this, your code tends to become unmanageable,
especially if you return to it after not touching it for several months.
It&amp;rsquo;s a code that you understand while you are writing, and certainly the
machine understands it, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;signposts&amp;rdquo; for future
visitors. They have to &amp;ldquo;explore&amp;rdquo; it to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option is to put a couple comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight lua"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- get nearest player within sight&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;math.huge&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ipairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;players&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- shoot a bullet to the player&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Bullet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;math.atan2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much, much better solution is extracting those two &amp;ldquo;different things&amp;rdquo;
into functions, ditch the comments, and use better names for the
variable while you are at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are doing this, you will suddenly realize that this function
isn&amp;rsquo;t really making two things. It&amp;rsquo;s doing &lt;strong&gt;LOTS&lt;/strong&gt; of things. Each one
of those things belongs to a different function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight lua"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shootAt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getNearest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;players&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getNearest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nearest&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shortestDistance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;math.huge&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ipairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;nearest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;shortestDistance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nearest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getSquaredDistance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shootAt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Bullet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getAngle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getAngle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;math.atan2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but I could not make &lt;code&gt;Turrent:getNearest&lt;/code&gt; any smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both programs do the same; for the machine, they are no different. But
for programmers, they are so much easier to understand and maintain.
Take a look at &lt;code&gt;Turret:update()&lt;/code&gt;! Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just beautiful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now that you have smaller functions, you can reuse them in other
places. I could move getDistance and getAngle to a Vector class, for
example. That way I could use code for calculating distances and angles
in all &lt;code&gt;Enemies&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Players&lt;/code&gt;, not just in my &lt;code&gt;Turret&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the &lt;code&gt;Turret&lt;/code&gt; is prepared to attack players, but it&amp;rsquo;s very
easy to subclass it now and create a turret that shoots other things,
like asteroids. Actually, let me show you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight lua"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AsteroidCleaningTurret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'AsteroidCleaningTurret'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Turret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;AsteroidCleaningTurret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getNearest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;asteroids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. If I create an &lt;code&gt;AsteroidCleaningTurret&lt;/code&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;ll start shooting
asteroids. In 4 lines. If the code of &lt;code&gt;Turret:update()&lt;/code&gt; was the first
version, I would have had to fiddle much more in order to do this. It&amp;rsquo;s
so easy to modify now! I could make a &lt;code&gt;DrunkenTurret&lt;/code&gt; that calculates
angles badly. Or one that shoots 4 bullets instead of just one. There&amp;rsquo;re
so many places you can tweak!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll just shut up now. I hope I made my point. Each function
should do just one thing because that&amp;rsquo;s better for the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
